- A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
- The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. They are first person singular.
- The third principal part of interficiō (interfēcī) is identical to prefixing inter- to a form of facio (fēcī). In the other forms of faciō, there is the letter a after the f instead of e or i which come after the f in the forms of interficiō.
- The verbs audīre and venīre belong to the fourth conjugation. Their principal parts are quite regular because the changes between the parts imitate the changes between parts of the other verbs in the vocabulary list. ❓*What about the fourth part? Can you predict it from the other three?*
- The changes in the principal parts of capiō and facio are similar because they both belong to the third conjugation, so their second principal parts have the same ending of ĕre.  ❓*How are their 3rd and 4th parts alike or different?*
