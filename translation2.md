***Translation***

Long ago, Prometheus, the first son of Iapetus, was fashioning humans out of mud. At the same time, Vulcan was making a woman out of mud. Minerva gave spirit to her and all the gods sent gifts to her. On account of this, the name "Pandora" was given to her. Pandora was given in marriage to Epimetheus by Jupiter. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
